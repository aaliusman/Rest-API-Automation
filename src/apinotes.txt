SoapUI – Service testing tool for webservices and REST APIs.
Client – UI and Front end
Server – Back end and data base.

Two important thing in API is:
    - How do you build your payload and how do you construct your request payload to send it to server.
    - Once you get your response you, how do you parse your response to scan for your actual value.

API – is an interface and play key role to of communication protocol between client and a server to simply the building
of client-side software. To simplify to design process.We use API to communicate between front end and back end.
It is also beneficial when it comes to programing language is used for front end is different than back end.
Which acts as interface between client and Server, also known has middleware layer between client and server.
API is independent of any language. Front-end send all the information to API using http request protocol.
We usually use Json or XML format to send information. They don’t belong to any specific language families.
API send request to back end, back response back to API and API response back to front end using http protocol.

All Webservices are API. All APIs are not web services. Like in our lectures,
Place and Library are Webservices but they can also be called APIs. And also like in JAVA,
we have APIs (e.g methods) but they cannot be called web services.

Rest API is easy to build and most of the big tech companies using Rest API.
End point/BASE URL: Address where API is hosted on the server. Hitting the endpoint.
4 commonly used http methods to communicate with REST Api.
GET, POST, PUT, DELTE – CRUD operations create, retrieve, update, delete.
GET: when you want to retrieve some existing information from server. While using GeT request, it should only extract
    data and should have o other effect on data. No payload/body required. We use query parameters to send input data in GET.
POST: A post request is used to send data to the server, for example:  customer information, file upload, etc.
    using HTML forms.
PUT: A put request is used to update existing information on server.
DELETE: Removes all current representation of the target resources given by a URI.

Resources: resources represent API/Collections which accessed from the server. Resource names need to be included in base URL.
 Like map/search/image shown below.
Base URL: google.com/map or google.com/search or google.com/map where APIs hosted.
There are two types of parameters, path parameter and query parameter.
Path Parameters: variable part of URL path, they are typically used to point to specific resource within a collection,
such a user identified by ID.  Amazon.com/orders/112 <- path parameters also known as sub resource.
Query Parameters: is used to sort/filer the resources. Using existing resource. Always identified by "?" Amazon.com/orders?sort_by=2/20/2020
https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=Ix_RX5DaHcur5NoP47SdkAc&q=new+york
once we get the response from API then front-end developers read the response and generate html page. Front end data is
 generated from API response we get.

End point request URL can constructed as below
Base URL/resource/(Query/Path)Parameter: server name where your request should go to, then resource to point out the
specific resource. IF Api demand to have parameters.

Headers/Cookies: Headers represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. In layman terms,
 we were sending Additional details to API to process our request. Example: Authorization details. We are sending
 additional detail to API. API should know what format you are sending request, you have to tell API what type of
 format should we use.

You need to get the API contact, BASE URL, Resource, parameters, http method, what is the json body, what does it look,
what is the response you are expecting. Your developers should share all details with you.

{
    "status": "OK",
    "place_id": "0f4b56ef5c25e8aed371828ebb6ff889",
    "scope": "APP",
    "reference": "a5b375c3a11bdcb6ce3fddbdef7b61cca5b375c3a11bdcb6ce3fddbdef7b61cc",
    "id": "a5b375c3a11bdcb6ce3fddbdef7b61cc"
}

1.	A URI is an identifier of a specific resource. Like a page, or book, or a document.
2.	A URL is special type of identifier that also tells you how to access it, such as HTTPs, FTP, etc.—like https://www.google.com.
3.	If the protocol (https, ftp, etc.) is either present or implied for a domain, you should call it a URL—even though it’s also a URI.

How to parse complex JSON. Json like Nested json or Json contains Nested Arrays. Very important to know how to parse complex JSON.
Arrays is collection of different elements. Arrays always inside the square bracket [“Hello”, “Yellow”]

Mock Response: You will get a contract first, Developer will start working on API, we shouldn’t wait until development
is done, parallelly we should be working on automation using mock/dummy response.

Types of Authentication to talk to our api.
cookies authentication and key value.

OAuth 2.0 API's using Postman and Rest Assured.
OAuth is an umbrella. Different ways of achieve this, different grant types.(I can say i have worked on Authorization code grant type).

To make your api more secure, comes with multiple authentication flow or multiple grant types. By using Authorization code and client credentials.
Strong and flexible security mechanism.
Example of OAuth 2.O, is when you try to sign in to some website instead of creating your own account you have an option
to use your google/Facebook account to sign in and get all your information from there.

Backend architecture of OAuth 2.0
Client -> ClientID(public)               ->    Client SecretID             -> Resource Owner -> Resource/Authorization Server
Gap.com   id That identifies the client        gap.com register with google   Human                  Google
Gmail/Google will provide your first name, last name and email to gap.com to make process easy for both client and user.

User will login to Google by hitting google Authorization server get code. Application will use this code to hit google resource server in back
end to get Access token. Once Access token expire google will stop sharing your info with client.
Application grants access to User by validating Access token.
most important thing is how to get access token.


Grant type: There are multiple types of grant type, we are using authorization code grant type.
Scope: what user information client need from google.
  two unique parameters:
    client_id: this will be generated when user first time sign in to google.
    client_secret: it's like a password.
response_type: what response you are expecting back from google.
redirect_url/CallbackURL: where google has to send back to your application or client, after you sign in successfully.
grant_type:
authorization server url: which 3rd party are you depending on, like facebook or google.
access token url: where we exchange our code and get our access token.
state: option parameter, random string.

Another grant type is client credentials. no involvement of human/user. if interaction is only between application and resource party. if user is involve
then it has to be authorization code.

Serialization and Deserialization of your Request/Response payload with help of POJO class. To parse your JSON or construct back your JSON as body. Also
we can use XML.

Serialization - Converting java object into one request body as JSON or XML(pay load). Setter will play key role.
    {
    "message": "Hello"
    }
  POJO - Plain old Java object

Deserialization - Concept is same as Serialization. we get value from response. Getter will play key role.
We will learn how to deal with nested Array JSON response using POJO class.
